### Things to do before quarantining laptops/everything
1) Laptops disconnect and forget NTUSECURE (just to be safe)
2) Check the Obstacle.py scripts to ensure correct IP addresses
- Ziyuan's laptop IP:
- Xuanhui's laptop IP:
- Brendon's laptop IP:
3) Stop all running scripts on Ziyuan's laptop
4) Ziyuan's laptop: activate yolov5 conda environment
5) Can start app.py?

### Things to do during 2 min preparation time
1) Android check Bluetooth connected to Rpi, key in obstacle coordinates
2) Make sure the imagerec and algo laptop is connected to RPi's wifi
3) (Imagerec)
- Check app.py is running well (on yolov5 env)
- Start bulleyes_check.py (in yolov5 env)
4) SSH into Rpi using Ziyuan's laptop
- cd Desktop
- standby run python Obstacle.py
5) (Algo)
- Run the algo script
- Let Rpi/Imagerec know
6) Rpi press reset button
7) SSH run python Obstacle.py
8) Android press send map
